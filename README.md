# Work-Planner

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a daily planner that allows the user to store their agenda in hour time slots.  In addition, the user is able to see the current time with a red background, past time slots in gray, and future time slots in green.  The user is able to save their input upon button click and the data is available after they refresh the page.
